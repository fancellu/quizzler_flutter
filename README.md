# Quizzler ‚ùì

A little Flutter app to show Stateful and Stateless Widgets as well as Dart OO, whilst I learn Flutter

# To run

``flutter run``

You can then target it an android/web or windows

https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli

## For web

To deploy to web
`flutter build web`

inside `build/web` you'll see what you need to copy to your web server. Make sure to edit the base href inside index.html to point to wherever you deploy it

You can see a web deploy here https://felstar.com/flutter/quizzler

In chrome you may see an icon to install locally as a PWA app in the location bar
